Hey there!
I'm Berkay; I'm 25, I'm an alumnus of [Ege University Computer Engineering][bilmuh] department, and I'm currently doing my Master's in [Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg][uni-freiburg] on Computer Science. In this blog, I'm planning to share from technical subjects to books I've been reading, so mostly what's on my mind. If you want to get more detailed information, you can take a look at my CV-ish [page][cagirme] too.

See you around!
